# UDIA
Unsupervised Discovery of Image Annotation

## Description

Many images include details that we'd want to review but we don't have enough information to do so. This may happen, for example, if you have an idea of what an empty road should look like but have no idea what else could exist on it. Here, we provide a system for detecting malignant areas in a Whole Slide Image (WSI) based on previously detected healthy data. There are many WSIs with general diagnoses, however it is difficult to discover WSIs that are annotated to the greatest degree possible. There's no need to annotate anything beforehand using this technique.
